## Features

* Create "places" based on geolocations
  - New places get the current geolocation
  - See a list of places
  - Manually switch between active places
  - Add/edit/delete places
  - Option to automatically switch places based on geolocation
  - Last known geolocation is saved
* Add tasks to places
  - Delete tasks
  - See a list of tasks associated with a place
* Fast
* Doesn't need Internet connection (coming soon)

## To Do

* Geolocation
  - Update an existing place to the current geolocation
  - Controls for geolocation (update interval)
  - Show geolocation info (maybe on hover)
* General
  - HTML5 application cache manifest (make it offline)
  - Remove jQuery dependency
  - Tests (probably QUnit)
  - Show help message on first load instead of a prompt
* Build
  - Package as W3C widget (`make widget`)
  - Maemo desktop widget
  - Chrome extension
  - Opera widget
  - Android wiget?
  - Firefox extension?
  - Safari extension?

## Ideas

* Tasks
  - Undo delete task
  - Optional due date / start date for tasks
  - Optional tags / hierachy for tasks (use # or /)
* Places
  - Grouping places (e.g. so places called "Superstore" have the same tasks)
  - Show a dynamic / static Google map
  - Update an existing place to the current geolocation
* Basic syncing
  - "Sync" changes the URL hash, which you can copy/paste/email how you want (maybe a huge QR code)

## Design Goals

* UX
  - UI should be easy to understand
  - Should be quick to add tasks
  - Should be very quick to delete tasks (use case: shopping list)
  - Should look ok
* Technology
  - Should be a single page HTML document
  - Work offline & without any server-side technology
  - Should be usable as a mobile / desktop widget

## Non-goals

* Login or server-side syncing between devices
* IE support
* Kitchen sink (editing / ordering tasks)
